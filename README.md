# WebCraft
Name derivative off Minecraft. Project created to compete in Progate Webathon 2019.

This project was created with simplicty in mind.It contains 3 html, 1 css and 1 javascript file.

The first page is the index page which was suppossed to redirect to Python and javascript but it only redirects to Python for now and everything else is redirected to Extra page.

Python uses the calculator screen concept but uses textarea instead of input to accept and display text.it uses Javascirpt to check what was entered and what is required and finally redirects to progate python page.

Extra just displays that the site is a work in progress and redirects to progate so they can continue browsing/learning till the site turns into something big in the future.

Update: I recently came to know that the background died and am not going to update it because it was for the competion and i would like to keep it that way for now and move on to different projects.
